title: Dan Kelley's blog
---

This blog, started in November 2023, is planned as a supplement to, and
eventually a replacement for, an [older blog](http://dankelley.github.io/blog/)
that has become difficult to maintain, owing to difficulties with Ruby on
macOS. The difference is that the present blog is generated in a github action,
so the folks at github can deal with the changing software landscape.
