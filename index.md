title: Dan Kelley's blog
---

Started in November 2023, this blog is a supplement to, and will eventually a
replacement for, an [older blog](http://dankelley.github.io/blog/) that had
become difficult to maintain, owing to difficulties with the Ruby system on the
author's macOS machine. In this new blog, a remote machine does the
page generation.
