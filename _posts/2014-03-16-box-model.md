# Introduction

Box models are popular in some branches of oceanography and other geophysical
disciplines, partly because they are simple to construct and to solve.  This
posting shows how to solve a box model in R, using the `lsoda()` function in
the `deSolve` package.

The basic ideas can be explained in the context of riverine input into a lake
that connects to the sea.  Readers with mathematical expertise will see easily
that the same method holds for a wide variety of problems. An oceanographer
might think of salinity reduction.  A meteorologist might think of the seasonal
lag of ocean temperature.  A pharmacologist might think of the concentration of
a drug in the bloodstream.  A contractor might think of water in a basement.
But let's stick to the lake, shall we?


# Model formulation

Let the lake surface area be *A*, and its water level be *h*, with the latter
being expressed as height above (constant) sea level.  Let the river input
volume per unit time be *R*.   Suppose that the lake drains into the sea with
volume output per unit time given by a linear law (as perhaps with
pressure-driven viscous flow) of the form $$\gamma h$$ where the coefficient
has units of area per time.

The principle of volume conservation yields the differential equation

$$A\frac{dh}{dt} = R - \gamma h$$

Here, the left-hand side is the changing volume of the lake (assuming vertical
coastline).  In this equation, *R* (with units m$$^3$$/s) may vary with time as
rivers flow and ebb, driven by rainfall or perhaps spring snow-melt.

In many circumstances it would make sense to non-dimensionalize the equation at
this point, but for practical purposes it can be convenient to retain physical
units.  For example, the task could be to find the response to an observed
time series $$R=R(t)$$ of forcing.

Expressing the model as

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{R-\gamma h}{A}$$

is helpful since this is a form that works well with `lsoda()`, the R function
to be used here to carry out the numerical integration of the differential
equation.



# Solution in R

The first step is to load the package containing `lsoda()`.


```R
library(deSolve)
```

Readers who are following along might want to type `?lsoda` in an R console at
this point, to get an idea of the reasoning being followed here.  The summary
is that `lsoda()` takes initial conditions as its first argument, a vector of
times at which to report the solution as its second argument, a function
defining the differential equation(s) as its third argument, and a list
containing model parameters in its fourth argument.

We start by defining initial conditions, in line 1.  In this case, suppose that
`h=0`, i.e. that the lake water level is equal to that of the sea.  Then, in
line 2, we set parameters.  This is at the heart of the matter, and will be the
most important part of any application of such a model.  Here, we take simple
values: $$h=0$$ initially, a lake of area $$A=4\times 10^6$$ m$$^2$$, and
outflow coefficient $$\gamma=20$$ m$$^2$$/s.

```R
IC <- 0
parms <- list(A = 4e6, gamma = 20)
```

Suppose we would like to examine the result of riverine input $$R$$ varying
from a base value of 1 m$$^3$$/s to a one-day increase to 10 m$$^3$$/s.  We may
do that as follows.  Note that the steady-state solution for the lower value of
$$R$$ is shown with a dotted line.

```R
sperday <- 86400 # seconds per day
times <- seq(0, 20*sperday, length.out = 500)
R <- function(t)
{
    1 + ifelse(10 * sperday < t & t < 11 * sperday, 9, 0)
}
```

(The length of `times` mainly matters to plotting; it has no effect on the
accuracy of the solution, i.e. we are not setting an integration time step
here.)

Next, set up the differential equation.  This has to follow a certain format.
The function must take time as first argument, current model state (a vector,
generally) as second, and parameters, third.  The function returns a list of
derivatives.

```R
DE <- function(t, y, parms)
{
    h <- y[1]
    dhdt <- (R(t) - parms$gamma * h) / parms$A
    list(dhdt)
}
```

Here, the state is extracted into a variable named `h` and the derivative is
stored in a variable named `dhdt`.  This is done merely for clarity of
illustration here; experienced programmers are likely to write `DE` as a
single-line function.

Computing the model solution is now easy:

```R
sol <- lsoda(IC, times, DE, parms)
```

defines `sol`, which has time as its first column and the solution as its
second.  We may plot the results as follows (where time is indicated in days
for simplicity).

# Results


```R
par(mfrow=c(2,1), mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,0.7,0))
h <- sol[,2]
Day <- times / 86400
plot(Day, R(times), type='l', ylab="River input [m^3/s]")
plot(Day, h, type='l', ylab="Lake level [m]")
abline(h = 1 / parms$gamma, lty = 2) # theoretical steady state for 1 m^3/s
```

In this case, the model is so simple that there is no real need for a numerical
simulation, but this would not be true if, say, realistically-varying $$R(t)$$
forcing was applied, if $$\gamma$$ were parameterized to vary with $$h$$
or $$dh/dt$$, etc.

# Conclusions

Those interested in box models might like to alter the parameters and forcing
function, to study the results.  

Adding more boxes is easy, and a good exercise for the reader.  Careful
adjustment of parameters in multi-box models can yield reasonably useful
alternatives to high-resolution numerical models, especially for exploratory
work.

It is also a simple matter to change the forcing and the model formulation.
For example, the outflow function could be made nonlinear, e.g. to account for
hydraulic-control effects.  Adding time dependence to parameterizations is not
difficult either, and it opens the possibility of using such models in wide
applications, e.g. modelling dam-break situations.  

At a more advanced level, one can also use such a model in a data-assimilative
way to infer parameter values from observations of quantities predicted by the
model.  For example, if lake area and river input were known for a given lake
then observations of lake level (compared with sea level) could yield a value
of $$\gamma$$ as formulated here, or formulated in a more sophisticated way,
e.g. depending on $$dh/dt$$, etc.

As mathematically-inclined readers might agree, and others might learn by a bit
of exploration, numerical experimentation can be a useful tool for increasing
understanding.
