# Introduction

Much of North America will experience a solar eclipse on 2024-04-08 (reference
1). At Halifax, Nova Scotia, the eclipse will be partial, starting at 15:27
local time. A few hour's drive from Halifax, the eclipse will be total.  If the
day is not too cloudy, there should be a lot of people experiencing this event.
Several websites provide advice for how to experience such events safely,
without risking severe permanent eye damage.

The `oce` functions `moonAngle()` and `sunAngle()` can provide a crude
indication of conditions on that day, and the purpose of this posting is to
show how.  It must be noted that more detailed calculations are required for
accurate eclipse predictions. Chapter 52 of reference 2 discusses this matter,
suggesting that readers consult the more specialized tables and formulations
presented in reference 3.

The code given at the bottom of this posting creates the diagrams for the day
before the eclipse, the day of the eclipse, and the day after. Notice that the
sun and moon traces overlap during late afternoon, as predicted. The separation
between the two traces is much greater on the days before and after, as would
likely be expected by readers who are familiar with tides, etc.
