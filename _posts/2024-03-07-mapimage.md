title: Demonstration of the Updated mapImage Function in oce
---

I have been making some changes to the oce function `mapImage()` lately, to
address an issue kindly pointed out by a user on github^[1:]. The problem is
that the image can have missing values at certain points, depending on the
projection being used, the geographical domain being shown, and the data grid
being plotted.

I won't get into details here.  I just want to illustrate the problem
and some solutions. This requires the very latest version of the
development branch of the oce code, as it will exist in perhaps a few
days or weeks, once the issue is closed.

At the bottom of this post I have sample code.  Notice that it has four
alternatives for the `mapImage()` call.  The results from those alternatives
are pasted below.

My preference is for option 1, which uses polygons for each longitude-latitude
grid cell.  It has the advantage, over the other methods, of showing the data
faithfully.

But sometimes filled contours are called for, perhaps because a smooth field is
thought to be more appealing than a tiling of polygons.  In this case, I would
start with option 2.  But if I see data gaps, as you can see below, I would
move to either option 3 or option 4.  There are pros and cons to both 3 and 4.
Option 3 does some extra smoothing, which may be desired for noisy data. On the
other hand, option 4 only alters the grid by filling in gaps, so it is closer
to the original data.

The `mapContour()` function should also be considered.  It has the advantage of
displaying contours without any of the gridding that is required for
`mapContour()` in options 2, 3 and 4. In other words, it is very close to the
data.  However, contours for noisy fields can be very messy.

The bottom line is that the oce package offers a range of choices. The best
choice depends on the nature of the data, as well as the intended audience.

**Method 1: using polygons, not filled contours.**

**Method 2: using filled contours, yielding gaps.**

**Method 3: using filled contours, with larger grid cells to fill gaps.**

**Method 4: using filled contours, with a gridder that fills gaps.**

**Code**

The images are made by uncommenting the various `mapImage()` blocks.

```R
library(oce)
data(coastlineWorld)
data(topoWorld)

# Northern polar region, with color-coded bathymetry
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(2, 2, 1, 1))
cm <- colormap(zlim = c(-5000, 0), col = oceColorsGebco)
drawPalette(colormap = cm)
mapPlot(coastlineWorld,
    projection = "+proj=stere +lat_0=90",
    longitudelim = c(-180, 180), latitudelim = c(70, 110)
)

# Method 1: the default, using polygons for lon-lat patches
mapImage(topoWorld, colormap = cm)

# Method 2: filled contours, with ugly missing-data traces
# mapImage(topoWorld, colormap = cm, filledContour = TRUE)

# Method 3: filled contours, with a double-sized grid cells
# mapImage(topoWorld, colormap = cm, filledContour = 2)

# Method 4: filled contours, with a gap-filling gridder)
# g <- function(...) binMean2D(..., fill = TRUE, fillgap = 2)
# mapImage(topoWorld, colormap = cm, filledContour = TRUE, gridder = g)


mapGrid(15, 15, polarCircle = 1, col = gray(0.2))
mapPolygon(coastlineWorld[["longitude"]],
    coastlineWorld[["latitude"]],
    col = "tan"
)
```
