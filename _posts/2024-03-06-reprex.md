title: Making reproducible R examples
---

When reporting issues with R software, it is very helpful to provide
*reproducible* code examples.  This means that the code is complete and
self-contained, and that the results are provided along with the code.

If you provide reproducible examples, you will be relieving the developers of
the need to contact you to get additional data files, to see the full output of
your code, and so forth.  This usually leads to a faster resolution to the
issue at hand, with less effort for both you and the developers.

The `reprex` package^[If `reprex` is not already installed, type
`install.packages("reprex)` to install it. Once it's installed, you will not
need to install it again.] makes it trivial to create reproducible examples in
R. Here are the steps:

1. Use your mouse (or some other scheme) to copy sample code onto your
   computer's clipboard.
2. In R, type `reprex::reprex()` to run your code and place it along with its
   output on the clipboard.
3. On a bug-reporting site (e.g. Reference 1, for the `oce` package), do a
   "paste" operation to put the clipboard contents into an issue comment.

It's as simple as that.
