title: Making reproducible R examples
---

When reporting issues with R software, it is very helpful to provide
*reproducible* code examples.  This means that the code is complete and
self-contained, and that the results are provided along with the code.

If you provide reproducible examples, you will be relieving the developers of
the need to contact you to get additional data files, to see the full output of
your code, and so forth.  This usually leads to resolution, and it always leads
to less effort, for both you and the developers.

The `reprex` package makes it trivial to create reproducible examples in R.
Here are the steps:

1. Use your mouse (or some other scheme) to copy sample code onto your
   computer's clipboard (or pasteboard, etc.; names vary).
2. In R, type `reprex::reprex()`.  This runs the code and places any output on
   the clipboard.
3. On a bug-reporting site (e.g. Reference 1, for the `oce` package), do a
   "paste" operation.  This inserts your code, along with its textual and/or
   graphical output.

It's as simple as that.
