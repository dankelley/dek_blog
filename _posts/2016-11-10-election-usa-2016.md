# Introduction

There was much to learn from studying how the 2016 USA presidential election
campaign unfolded. The final results have not been tallied to date, although
the outcome is clear now.

As an educator, I am particularly curious about possible linkages between
educational level and voting preference. This is a matter covered in various
exit polls and other studies, but I wanted to get into the data myself.

With this motivation, I downloaded state-by-state educational data and voting
data from references 1 and 2, and stored them in this blog, so that the R code
I present at the end can make the following graph.

My focus was on the percentage of the population educated beyond the Bachelor
level, since that proved to be the educational variable with the highest
explanatory power.

As a measure of voting preference, I constructed an index defined as
*(D-R)/(D+R)* where *D* is the number of votes cast for the Democrat, and *R*
is the number cast for the Republican. This index is zero in a tied state, with
positive values indicating a preference for Clinton and negative values a
preference for Trump.  By definition, the index is bound to lie between -1 and
+1, i.e. between 100% votes for the Republican and 100% for the Democrat.  I
did not perform regression analysis, because it is not clear what that would
mean if applied to this index.

# Results

![2016 USA election](/dek_blog/docs/assets/images/2016-11-10-election-usa-2016.png)

In the resultant graph, the vertical line indicates an educational level of
10.2%, which was chosen by visual inspection as a divider between
Trump-favouring and Clinton-favouring educational levels.  The blue dots
indicate a preference for Clinton over Trump.


A noticeable feature is the isolated point indicating high educational level
and strong preference for Clinton. This is the District of Columbia, which may
have a particular reason to favour Clinton, since Trump has pledged to "drain
the swamp."

The overall data cloud reveals stronger trend of preference for Clinton in
states with higher educational level.

Focussing on which candidate won the count, it is possible to construct a
simple statement about the results of this election.

* In 18 of the 18 states in which 10.2% or more of the population holds an
  advanced degree, Clinton is favoured over Trump.

* Trump is favoured in 30 of the remaining 33 states.

# Conclusions

Clinton won a majority of the votes in states with high educational levels.
