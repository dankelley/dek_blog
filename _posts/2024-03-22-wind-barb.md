title: Drawing Wind Barbs with the oce R Package
---

# Introduction

Recently, an oce user named Max Dupilka asked (see
[https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/2191](https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/2191))
whether oce could draw "wind-barb" diagrams.  This struck me an oce co-author
Clark Richards as a good idea.  So, with a *lot* of help from Max, I added this
feature.

The feature will soon be inserted into the existing `mapDrawDirectionField()`
function, but for a week or so it will reside in a temporary function named
`mapDrawDirectionFieldNEW()`.  (I will alter this blog item when I make this
switch.)

In this blog entry, I'll show how to use this function.  First, though, you'll
need to see how to update your version of oce to the development version.

# Gaining Access to the oce Update

This may not appear in 

CRAN
([https://cran.r-project.org/package=oce](https://cran.r-project.org/package=oce))
for a few months, given CRAN policies on updates to packages.  But, if you have
    a system that is set up to build R packages from source (which requires C,
    C++ and Fortran compilers), you can install the update by typing the
    following in an R session.  (Install the `remotes` package first, if you
    don't have it already.)

```R
remotes::install_github("dankelley/oce", ref = "develop")
```

# An Idealized Example

![wind barbs](/dek_blog/docs/assets/images/2024-03-22-wind-barb.png)

The diagram given above is an example. I created it by imagining
Gaussian-shaped low-pressure zone centred over the southern part of Hudson's
Bay (visible as the red dot in the northwest region of the figure), and
computing winds with the geostrophic formulae.

The code is at the bottom of this post.  As you can see, I constructed a fairly
dense grid of longitudes and latitudes to get smooth contours (red), but
sub-sampled for the barbs.  If I had not sub-sampled, the barbs would have been
quite crowded.  (You may also control the lengths of the wind indicators, and
the widths of the barbs; type `?mapDrawDirectionField` to learn more.)

# How to Read a Wind-Barb Diagram

If the speed at a given location is exactly zero, a dot is drawn there.

For non-zero speeds, a line segment is drawn in the upwind direction. The
lengths of these segments are designed to cover equal distance over the ground
(accounting for the projection used in the map).

If the speed is under 2.5 knots (i.e. if it rounds to 0), then the segment is
all that is drawn. For higher speeds, barbs and pennants may be drawn,
depending on the speed.

If the speed rounds to 5 knots, a single short barb is drawn near the end of
the main segment. You can see one of these, extending from the southern edge of
Newfoundland.

If the speed rounds to 10 knots, a long barb is drawn at the end.

For higher speeds, long and short barbs are drawn (the short ones closer to the
origin point). For example, the long and short barb for winds near Cape Breton
indicate a speed of 15 knots. This pattern continues until 50 knots is reached.
At 50 knots a pennant (triangle) is drawn.  You can see some pennants at
towards the northeast of the diagram, where lines of constant pressure are
closest together.

This scheme makes it easy to infer the speed at any spot. Start with 0 knots.
Add 5 knots for each short barb. Then add 10 knots for each normal barb. And
then add 50 knots for each pennant. The sum is the speed, rounded to 5 knots.


# Using Other Units

I have seen displays use km/hour instead of knots, but retain the 5:10:50
scheme for short barbs, normal barbs, and pennants.  Of course, it is easy to
use `mapDirectionFieldNEW()` to accommodate this or any other 5:10:50 scheme,
simply by using a multiplier on velocity.

If your interest is in wind stress, consider using stress instead of velocity.
For example, a rough value for wind speed over the North Atlantic is 10m/s.
Using air density 1.2 kg/m^3 with a quadratic drag coefficient of 0.002 (say),
this yields a stress of 0.24 Pa. This might suggest using short barbs could be
used for stress increments of 0.1 Pa, normal barbs for 0.2 Pa, and pennants for
0.5 Pa.




# R Code to Make the Example

```R
library(oce)
data(coastlineWorldFine, package = "ocedata")
par(mar = rep(2, 4))
mapPlot(coastlineWorldFine,
    border = gray(0.7),
    col = grey(0.95),
    projection = "+proj=lcc +lat_1=40 +lat_2=60 +lon_0=-65",
    longitudelim = c(-80, -50), latitudelim = c(40, 50)
)
# fake a geostrophic wind field centred in lower Hudson's Bay
model <- function(x, y, latitude, R = 100e3, rho = 1.2,
                  highP = 101.5e3, lowP = 98e3) {
    E <- exp(-(x^2 + y^2) / R^2)
    deltaP <- highP - lowP
    P <- highP - deltaP * E
    dPdx <- 2 * deltaP * x / R^2 * E
    dPdy <- 2 * deltaP * y / R^2 * E
    f <- oce::coriolis(latitude)
    u <- -dPdy / rho / f
    v <- dPdx / rho / f
    list(P = P, dPdx = dPdx, dPdy = dPdy, u = u, v = v)
}

nlon <- 50
nlat <- nlon + 1
lon <- seq(-100, -30, length.out = nlon)
lat <- seq(30, 60, length.out = nlat)
g <- expand.grid(lon = lon, lat = lat)
xy <- lonlat2map(g$lon, g$lat)
xyc <- lonlat2map(-81.30, 53.01) # Akimiski Island (Hudson's Bay)
m <- model(xy$x - xyc$x, xy$y - xyc$y,
    latitude = g$lat, R = 1000e3, lowP = 97e3, highP = 101e3
)
mps2knot <- 1.94384 # 1 m/s is 1.94384 knots
u <- mps2knot * matrix(m$u, nrow = length(lon))
v <- mps2knot * matrix(m$v, nrow = length(lon))
P <- matrix(m$P, nrow = length(lon))
mapContour(lon, lat, P, drawlabels = FALSE, col = 2, lwd = 1)
lx <- seq(1, length(lon), 4)
ly <- seq(1, length(lat), 4)
mapDirectionFieldNEW(lon[lx], lat[ly], u[lx, ly], v[lx, ly],
    lwd = 1.4,
    code = "barb", scale = 2, length = 0.25
)
points(xyc$x, xyc$y, pch = 20, cex = 3, col = 2)
```
