title: Drawing Wind Barbs with the oce R Package
---

# Introduction

A while ago, an oce user named Max Dupilka
[asked](https://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues/2191) whether oce could draw
"wind-barb" diagrams.  With a lot of help from Max, I added this feature. In a
week or so, it will likely be inserted into the existing
`mapDrawDirectionField()` function, but for a testing period it will reside in
a temporary function named `mapDrawDirectionFieldNEW()`. In this blog entry,
I'll show how to use this function.

# Gaining Access to the oce Update

This may not appear in CRAN for a few months, given CRAN policies on updates to
packages.  But, if you have a system that is set up to build R packages from
source (which requires C, C++ and Fortran compilers), you can install the
update by typing the following in an R session.  (Install the `remotes` package
first, if you don't have it already.)

```R
remotes::install_github("dankelley/oce", ref = "develop")
```

# An Example

The diagram below is an example. What I have done here is to imagine a
Gaussian-shaped low-pressure zone centred over the southern part of Hudson's
Bay (visible as the red dot on the top axis of the plot).

As you can see from the code at the bottom of this post, I constructed a fairly
dense grid of longitudes and latitudes in my simulation, so that the contours
of pressure (red) would be smooth. But if I drew barbs for each of those
points, the page would be a mass of black ink, so I sub-sampled the wind data
for the barbs.  My method for doing that might be of use to some readers.

Here's how to read this sort of diagram.  From each longitude and latitude
point where there is an observation or model prediction, draw a line segment
that points upwind, and that covers a fixed distance over the ground. Then
round the speed to the nearest multiple of 5 knots. (Conversion: 1 m/s equals
1.94384 knots.)

If the speed is nonzero, but rounds to 0, the segment is not adorned.  If
the speed rounds to 5 knots, a single short barb is drawn near the end of
the main segment. You can see one of these, extending from the southern
edge of Newfoundland. If the speed rounds to 10 knots, draw a long barb
at the end.  For higher speeds, continue to add long or short barbs, with
the long ones at the end and short ones nearer the origin. For example,
the long and short barb for winds near Cape Breton indicate a speed of 15
knots. This pattern continues until 50 knots is reached.  For 50 knots,
draw a triangle (called a pennant).  And that's it.  Simply add up the
components to find the speed.
