title: Spline and other data smoothing

Smoothing data is quite a common task in the analysis of oceanographic data. If
we can think of errors (or uncertainties -- you pick the word you like) as
occurring just in the "y" variable, then I tend to try two approaches: (1) fit
a smoothing spline and (2) interpolate the data to a uniform grid and then
apply a smoothing digital filter.

The graph shows a typical result.  It shows the co-dependence of two properties
of seawater: density (on the x axis) and something called "spiciness" (on the y
axis).  I am interested in locating spots on this graph where the slope is
zero.

I will let the graph and the code speak for themselves.  If you try this kind
of thing on your own data, I think you'll find that you can get reasonably
consistent results with the methods illustrate here, after adjusting
parameters. Because there are no agreed-upon methods for selecting such
parameters, I advise exploring with representative data, to find values that
suit your goals, and to see how the results vary if those parameters are
adjusted across what is a reasonable range for the application of interest.

# Code

This code requires an Argo data file (line 2) that is not provided on this blog
posting.

```R
library(oce)
file <- "~/data/argo/D4901076_061.nc"
a <- read.oce(file)
sig0 <- a[["sigma0"]]
pi0 <- a[["spiciness0"]]
png("2024-02-16_spline.png", height = 7, width = 7, unit = "in", res = 200)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(3.5, 3.5, 1, 1), mgp = c(2, 0.7, 0), lwd = 1.4)
plot(sig0, pi0,
    xlab = resizableLabel("sigma0"),
    ylab = resizableLabel("spiciness0"),
    ylim = rev(range(pi0)),
    cex = 0.8
)
deltaSigma <- 0.01
n <- 9 # must be an odd number
df <- length(sig0) / 3
sig0out <- seq(min(sig0), max(sig0), deltaSigma)
a <- approx(sig0, pi0, sig0out)
lines(a$x, lowpass(a$y, n = n), col = 1, lwd = 2)
s1 <- smooth.spline(pi0 ~ sig0, df = df)
ps1 <- predict(s1, sig0out)
lines(ps1$x, ps1$y, col = 2)
s2 <- smooth.spline(a$y ~ a$x, df = df)
ps2 <- predict(s2, sig0out)
lines(ps2$x, ps2$y, col = 3)
s3 <- smooth.spline(a$y ~ a$x, df = df * 2)
ps3 <- predict(s3, sig0out)
lines(ps3$x, ps3$y, col = 4)

grid()
legend("bottomleft",
    lwd = 1, col = 1:4, bg = "white",
    legend = c(
        "lowpass",
        "smoothing spline on raw data",
        "smoothing spline on gridded data",
        "smoothing spline on gridded data (df doubled)"
    )
)
```
