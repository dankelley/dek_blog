# Introduction

Today there was a solar eclipse that was not visible on my side of the
Atlantic, but was seen on the European side, either as a partial eclipse,
towards the south, or a total one, towards the north [1]. Eclipses being rare
and solar power being a new thing, this event caused unprecedented reduction of
solar power [2].

A good spot for viewing the total eclipse was Longyearbyen, on Svalbard, and
readers seeking good images might want to include that name in web searches. (I
could not find open-source images at the time of writing, but of course that
was not really my goal in this blog posting...)

I thought it might be interesting to see whether the sun and moon functions in
the oce package could reproduce the eclipse timing, so I constructed a function
to measure the mismatch between sun and moon position in the sky, and set up an
optimization problem to find the time of least mismatch.

The oce functions `sunAngle()` and `moonAngle()` are at the heart of the work.
Each returns a list that contains, among other things, `altitude` and
`azimuth`. I set up a mismatch function to calculate a combination of these,
with a scale factor to account for the convergence of lines of constant
azimuth.

Below is the code, and the graph it makes. The official time and the time
inferred here differ by approximately 4 minutes.  I suspect this is because of
the approximate nature of the formulae in oce (see the documentation for the
functions used).

angle <- function(t, lon = 15 + 40 / 60, lat = 78 + 12 / 60) {

    sqrt((scale * (saz - maz))^2 + (sal - mal)^2)
